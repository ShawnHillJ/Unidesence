# Unidesence
This is an Open-Source project coded in Python within the Blender Game Engine. The player is given a randomized world to build and survive the relentless mobs that plague the realm. The user achieves this through a helpful companion named BlockBot, and together, the user can build a world his or her own.

The main version of the game contains all modifications and approved additions to the main game. All beta features that are not implemented will exist in the beta branch until approved for push to main branch.

The planned version changes will follow this order:

World and Biome Generation + Player items and crafting + Story Updates + V1.0.0 Update
