# Unidesence
This is an Open-Source project coded in Python within the Blender Game Engine. The player is given a randomized world to build and survive
 the relentless mobs that plague the realm. The user achieves this through a helpful companion named BlockBot, and together, the user can 
build a world his or her own.

This is the revival branch, started Sunday, 18th of June, 2017. This branch, created a year after the last updates to the original game,
 will be the last attempt to create a true working verion of the idealized game. However, this will require the complete reworking of the
 original code, due to the fact it was produced with severely outdated (and novice-level) programming techniques. 

#The To-Do (coming features)
-migrate from Python 2.7 to 3.5
-dump perlin noise and use built-in random for world_gen
-create module to integrate bge constants in one line
-begin fixing my bad code
...

#The Checked-Off (changelog)
-make this branch
-organize files into proper directories
-verify files have proper extensions
